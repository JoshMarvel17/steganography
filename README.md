# steganography

This project is for CPSC 353 by Joshua Marvel

Description: 

Steganography is the pratice of concealing messages or information within other nonsecret text or data.

The goal of this project is to be able to conceal a hidden message in the RGB values of the pixels by altering the least significant bit.  

I was only able to implement the decoding of a image to work.  This function is called retrieval which will retrieve the hidden message in a file.
